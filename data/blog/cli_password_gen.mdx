# Create a Password Generator in PHP

Generating passwords is a common task for developers. In this tutorial, we will create a simple password generator in PHP. Let's walk through the process of building a simple CLI tool for generating random passwords.

## Setting Up the Command Line Interface

Let's start by creating a new file called `password-generator.php` inside the `password-generator` directory.

```bash
touch cli-passwd-gen.php
```

```php
#!/usr/bin/env php
```

To set up the command line interface, we'll need to use PHP's built-in `getopt()` function. It will allow the program to take in arguments and options and return an associative array of options and their values.

```php
#!/usr/bin/env php
<?php

$options = getopt('l:u:s:n:h', [
    'lowercase:',
    'uppercase:',
    'symbols:',
    'numbers:',
    'help'
]);
```

**Note:** Notice the `#!` at the top of the file. This is called a shebang and we need to add this to the top of the `bash` file, in order to tell the operating system which interpreter to use when executing the file. In our case, it will be the PHP interpreter.

We need to make the file executable.

```bash
chmod +x cli-passwd-gen.php
```
