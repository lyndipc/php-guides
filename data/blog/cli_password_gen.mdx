## Overview

Generating passwords is a common task for developers. In this tutorial, we will create a simple password generator in PHP. Let's walk through the process of building a simple CLI tool for generating random passwords.

## Setting Up the Command Line Interface

Let's start by creating a new file for our project. I've named mine `newpass.php`. Navigate to the directory where you would like to create the file and run the following command with your desired file name:

```bash
touch newpass.php
```

### Options

First off, we will need to allow our users to interact with the program. That means that we'll be using PHP's built-in `getopt()` function. The `getopt()` function allows the program to parse arguments in order to generate the password. Let's take a look at the following code:

```php
#!/usr/bin/env php
<?php

$options = getopt('l:u:s:n:c:p:h', [
    'lowercase',
    'uppercase',
    'symbols',
    'numbers',
    'custom-symbols',
    'length:',
    'help'
]);
```

In this piece of code, we are allowing the interpreter to parse the following arguments:

`-l` or `--length`\
`-u` or `--uppercase`\
`-s` or `--symbols`\
`-n` or `--numbers`\
`-c` or `--custom-symbols`\
`-p` or `--length`\
`-h`, or `--help`

If you look closely, you will notice in the code snippet that the `length` option has a colon `:` after it. This means that a value must be supplied with the option. In this case, we want the user to specify the length of the password. Therefore, the value will need to be an integer.

You may also wonder why we have two different options related to symbols. The first one, `-s, --symbols`, is for the default symbols that we will set for use in the password. The second one, `-c, --custom-symbols` is for custom symbols that the user can specify. Sometimes, websites and applications prevent the use of certain symbols. So, we want to give the user the option to specify their own symbols.

#### Shebang

Notice the `#!` at the top of the file. This is called a shebang. We need to add this to the top of the `bash` file in order to tell the operating system which interpreter to use when executing the file. In our case, it will be the PHP interpreter.

```php
#!/usr/bin/env php
```

### Default Values

Next, we will set some default values for our options. We will use the `array_merge()` function to merge the default values with the values that the user specifies.

```php
$defaults = [
    'lowercase' => true,
    'uppercase' => true,
    'symbols' => true,
    'numbers' => true,
    'custom-symbols' => '',
    'length' => 28,
];

$options = array_merge($defaults, $options);
```

Now, if the user runs the program without specifying any options, a random password will be generated using all options and the default length of 28 characters.

So far, we have only defined two associative arrays: `$options` and `$defaults`. Let's create new arrays called `$lowercase`, `$uppercase`, `$symbols`, and `$numbers` and add the characters that we want to use for each option. `newpass` will use these arrays to generate the password.

```php
$lowercase = range('a', 'z');
$uppercase = range('A', 'Z');
$symbols = str_split('!@#$%^&*()_+-=[]{};:,.<>/?');
$numbers = range(0, 9);
```

### Help

Let's add a help message for the user. We will use the `array_key_exists()` function to check if the user has specified the `--help` option. If they have, we will display the help message and exit the program.

```php
if (array_key_exists('h', $options) || array_key_exists('help', $options)) {
    echo <<<HELP
Usage: newpass [options]

Options:
    -l, --lowercase         Use lowercase letters. Default: true
    -u, --uppercase         Use uppercase letters. Default: true
    -s, --symbols           Use symbols. Default: true
    -n, --numbers           Use numbers. Default: true
    -c, --custom-symbols    Use custom symbols. Default: ''
    -p, --length <int>      The length of the password. Default: 28
    -h, --help              Display this help message and exit.

HELP;
    exit;
}
```

#### The HereDoc Syntax

You may have noticed the `<<<HELP` syntax in the code snippet above. This is called the HereDoc syntax. It allows us to create a multi-line string. The string will end when the closing identifier is found at the beginning of a line. In our case, the closing identifier is `HELP`. You can use any identifier you want, as long as it is not a PHP reserved word.

Lastly, we need to make the file executable.

```bash
chmod +x cli-passwd-gen.php
```
