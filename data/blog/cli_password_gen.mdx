## Overview

<TOCInline toc={props.toc} exclude="Overview" heading={(2, 3)}></TOCInline>

Generating passwords is a common task for developers. In this tutorial, we will create a simple password generator in PHP. Let's walk through the process of building a simple CLI tool for generating random passwords.

## Set Up the Project

Let's begin by creating a new file for our project. I've named mine `newpass.php`. Navigate to the directory where you would like to create the file and run the following command with your desired file name:

```bash
touch newpass.php
```

## Options

First off, we will need to allow our users to interact with the program. That means that we'll be using PHP's built-in `getopt()` function. This will allow our password generator to parse arguments from the command line in order to generate the password according to the user's requirements. Let's take a look at the following code:

```php
#!/usr/bin/env php
<?php

$shortopts = 'lusnt:h';
$options = getopt($shortopts, [
    'lowercase',
    'uppercase',
    'symbols',
    'numbers',
    'length:',
    'help'
]);
```

In this piece of code, we are allowing the interpreter to parse the following arguments:

`-l` or `--lowercase`\
`-u` or `--uppercase`\
`-s` or `--symbols`\
`-n` or `--numbers`\
`-t` or `--length`\
`-h`, or `--help`

#### `getopt()` Syntax

```php
getopt(string $shortopts, array $longopts, array &$options): array
```

The `getopt()` function takes three arguments. The first argument is a string of the short options; in our case, we are passing in the `$shortopts` string. The second argument is an array of the long options. The third argument is an array of the user's input.

The third argument is optional. If you do not specify the third argument, the `getopt()` function will parse the user's input from the command line. This is our goal, so we have not passed in a third argument.

### Length Option

If you look closely, you will notice in the code snippet that the `length` or `t` option has a colon `:` after it. This means that a value must be supplied with the option. Here, we want the user to specify the length of the password by passing in an integer. If the user does not specify a length, we will use the default length of 28 characters.

### What is a shebang?

In case you were wondering, the funny symbol `#!` at the top of the file is called a shebang. We need to add this to the top of the file along with the path in order to tell the operating system which interpreter to use when executing the file. We will learn how to make the file excutable later on in this tutorial. For now, be sure to add a shebang to the top of your file like this:

```php
#!/usr/bin/env php
```

## Check User Input

In order to actually generate the password, our program needs to actually understand what the user requires. Have they specified desired character types or a length? We will use a combination of ternary conditionals along with the `isset()` function to check for the user's input.

```php

// Lowercase letters option
isset($options['lowercase']) || isset($options['l']) ? $options['lowercase'] = true : $options['lowercase'] = false;

// Uppercase letters option
isset($options['uppercase']) || isset($options['u']) ? $options['uppercase'] = true : $options['uppercase'] = false;

// Symbols option
isset($options['symbols']) || isset($options['s']) ? $options['symbols'] = true : $options['symbols'] = false;

// Numbers option
isset($options['numbers']) || isset($options['n']) ? $options['numbers'] = true : $options['numbers'] = false;

// Length option
isset($options['length']) || isset($options['t']) ? $options['length'] = $options['length'] ?? $options['t'] : $options['length'] = 28;
```

Let's break down a couple of these for a better understanding.

```php
isset($options['lowercase']) || isset($options['l']) ? $options['lowercase'] = true : $options['lowercase'] = false;
```

In this line of code, we are checking if the user has specified the `lowercase` or `l` option. If they have, we will set the value of the `lowercase` key in the `$options` array to `true`. If they have not, we will set the value of the `lowercase` key in the `$options` array to `false`.

```php
isset($options['length']) || isset($options['t']) ? $options['length'] = $options['length'] ?? $options['t'] : $options['length'] = 28;
```

In this line of code, we are checking if the user has specified the `length` or `t` option. If they have, we will set the value of the `length` key in the `$options` array to the value that the user has specified. If they have not, we will set the value of the `length` key in the `$options` array to the default value of 28.

**Note:** You can also use an `if` statement instead of a ternary conditional. Although, I prefer to use ternary conditionals because they are more concise and easier to read. Use what works best for you.

## Help Message

Our users may not know how to use our password generator. Let's create a helpful message and key with each of the options. Here, we can use the `array_key_exists()` function to check if the user has specified the `--help` or `-h` option. If they have, we will display the help message and exit the program.

```php
if (array_key_exists('h', $options) || array_key_exists('help', $options)) {
    echo <<<HELP
Usage: newpass [options]

Description:
    Generate a random password. If no options are specified, a random password will be generated using all options and the default length of 28 characters. The password will be printed to the console.

Options:
    -l, --lowercase         Use lowercase letters. Default: true
    -u, --uppercase         Use uppercase letters. Default: true
    -s, --symbols           Use symbols. Default: true
    -n, --numbers           Use numbers. Default: true
    -t, --length <int>      The length of the password. Default: 28 characters
    -h, --help              Display this help message and exit.

HELP;
    exit;
}
```

### The HereDoc Syntax

You may have noticed the `<<<HELP` syntax in the code snippet above. This is called the HereDoc syntax. It allows us to create a multi-line string. The string will end when the closing identifier is found at the beginning of a line. In our case, the closing identifier is `HELP`. You can use any identifier you want, as long as it is not a PHP reserved word.

## Default Values

In the situation that our user does not specify any options, we will need to set default values. We have already handled the default value for `length` earlier, so we are only concerned with our boolean options.

To do this, let's check the falsiness of each option. If _all_ boolean options are falsy, we will set all of their values to `true` and the `length` value to 28. However, if the user has set _any_ of the boolean options to `true`, we will not set any of the boolean options to `true`. This will prevent our program from overriding the user's selections.

```php
if (!($options['lowercase']) && !($options['uppercase']) && !($options['symbols']) && !($options['numbers'])) {
    $options['lowercase'] = true;
    $options['uppercase'] = true;
    $options['symbols'] = true;
    $options['numbers'] = true;
}
```

Now, if the user runs the program without specifying any options, a random password will be generated using all options and the default length of 28 characters.

## Character Sets

So far, we have set up the user options but we need to translate these into values for our password. Let's create new arrays called `$lowercase`, `$uppercase`, `$symbols`, and `$numbers` and add the characters that we want to use for each option. `newpass` will use these arrays to generate the password.

```php
$lowercase = range('a', 'z');
$uppercase = range('A', 'Z');
$symbols = str_split('!@#$%^&*()_+-=[]{};:,.<>/?');
$numbers = range(0, 9);
```

## Generate the Password

Now that we have our character sets, we can generate the password. First, we need to filter out which character sets the user wants to use.

```php
$characters = array_filter([
    $options['lowercase'] ? $lowercase : null,
    $options['uppercase'] ? $uppercase : null,
    $options['symbols'] ? $symbols : null,
    $options['numbers'] ? $numbers : null,
]);
```

Next, we need to flatten the array of character sets into a single array. Then, we can shuffle the array to randomize the order of the characters.

```php
$characters = array_merge(...$characters);
shuffle($characters);
```

Now we are ready to generate the password. We will use the `array_rand()` function to select random keys from the `$characters` array. The number of keys that we select will be equal to the length of the password that the user has specified. The easiest way to do this is by looping through the `$characters` array and selecting a random key for each iteration.

```php
$password = '';

// Randomly select characters to add to the password
for ($i = 0; $i < $options['length']; $i++) {
    $password .= $characters[array_rand($characters)];
}
```

And we can print the password using an `echo` statement.

```php
echo $password . PHP_EOL;
```

## Test the Program

Time to test out our program. Navigate to the directory where you saved the password generator file. Let's start with a basic command:

```bash
php newpass.php
```

If you chose to name your password generator differently, change the file name in the command above to match yours. You should see a random password printed to the console that is 28 characters long and contains all character types.

Let's try specifying a length of 16 characters and use a shortened version of the options. The order of the options does not matter.

```bash
php newpass.php -t 16 -ln
```

You should see a random password printed to the console that is 16 characters long and contains only lowercase letters and numbers.

The shortened options can be combined into a single string (as seen in the last snippet) or separated like this:

```bash
php newpass.php -t 16 -l -n
```

Let's try specifying a length of 10 characters and use the full version of the options.

```bash
php newpass.php --length 10 --lowercase --uppercase --symbols
```

You should see a random password printed to the console that is 10 characters long and contains all character types.

You can also use a combination of the short and long options.

```bash
php newpass.php -t 10 --lowercase --numbers --symbols
```

You should see a random password printed to the console that is 10 characters long and contains lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.

## Add the Program to Your Path

Now that we have a working password generator, we can add it to our path so that we can run it from anywhere. First, we need to move the file to a directory that is already in our path. I have chosen to move my file to `/usr/local/bin`. You can move your file to any directory that is in your path.

```bash
mv newpass.php /usr/local/bin/newpass
```

Next, we need to make the file executable.

```bash
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/newpass
```

You should be able to run your program from anywhere in the terminal by typing `newpass` along with your desired options.

```bash
newpass -t 16 -lus
```
